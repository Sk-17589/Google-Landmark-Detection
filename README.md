# Google Landmark Detection Project Using Anaconda Jupyter Notebook

## Overview
The Google Landmark Detection Project utilizes the Google Landmark Dataset V2 to build a model capable of recognizing and classifying landmarks in images. This project is executed in an Anaconda Jupyter Notebook environment, leveraging deep learning techniques to enhance the accuracy of landmark identification.

## Features
- Utilizes the Google Landmark Dataset V2 for training and evaluation.
- Implements state-of-the-art deep learning architectures for image classification.
- Provides visualizations of model performance through metrics such as accuracy and loss curves.
- User-friendly interface to interact with the Jupyter Notebook for experimentation and analysis.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to explore the capabilities of machine learning and deep learning in the context of image classification, specifically for recognizing global landmarks. By utilizing a robust dataset, the project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of modern algorithms in accurately identifying landmarks, which has practical applications in fields such as tourism, navigation, and automated image tagging.
